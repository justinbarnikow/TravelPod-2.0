# Travel Pod 2.O
https://travelpod.vercel.app/

Travel Pod 2.0 is an updated version of the original Travel Pod, which was the first official project I ever made. TravelPod 2.0 makes use of React instead of jQuery, and has changed from a single-page, single-file site to a complex multi-page React app.

## Description
Travel Pod is an app-based site created for users looking for a podcast for an upcoming drive. Users can enter their starting location and final destination, as well as their podcast interests, and a curated list of podcasts will be shown to the user. It is a list based on the length of the user's trip. This is done by multiple API's taking the location and turning it into GPS coordinates, putting the trip distance in minutes, and appending podcasts of a certain length with a specified margin of error.

## Motivation
I wanted a podcast search engine that really filled a specific need for people. Users shouldn't have to worry about playing a new podcast while driving, or always keeping track of "where they left off" because the drive and podcasts are totally different lengths.
